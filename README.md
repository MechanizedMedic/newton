# newton

This project is a 3D printer that I have named Newton, which was the middle name of my beloved grandfather.

The design is inspired by the Sli3DR and QuadRap printers by Richard Horne (RichRap) and Shauki Bagdadi, respectively. These two gentlemen have unwittingly helped me muster the courage to attempt this build. So, a big thanks to them!

Now, let's see if I can make something out of this!
